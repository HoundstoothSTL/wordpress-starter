# Just a starter setup for WordPress Development

This is what we use to start off our projects.  We plan on updating this a lot and will have more info soon for the Readme if you're interested.

## Usage

To use just clone it to your local machine and navigate to the directory and run `./scaffold.sh desired_url.dev`

We run all of our local sites as .dev but you can change it to whatever you like, so if you were starting a project for say, Sony, you could run `./scaffold.sh sony.dev` and then just fill in all the questions from there.

You'll probably want to jump into the scaffold.sh script and replace some of the variables at the top marked as #TODO.
